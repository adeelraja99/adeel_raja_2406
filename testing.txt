According to the situation, I have decided to test the system by using most of the IF THEN ELSE statements by implementing them in to the features.


CUSTOMER

IF Customer ORDERS,
THEN show him the inventory, 
ELSE Go Back and repeat the TEST



ORDER

IF ORDER processes smoothl,
y THEN go to the next step, 
ELSE repeat the test



TRANSACTION

IF Transaction processes,
THEN go to the next test, 
ELSE repeat the test



SUPPLIER

IF supplier gets notified of stock,
THEN go to the next step, 
ELSE go back and repeat the test



INVENTORY

IF inventory gets updated,
THEN go to the next step, 
ELSE go back and repeat the test.



EMPLOYEE

IF Employee processes the order,
THEN proceed, 
ELSE go back and repeat the test.
